# Packages

## mongoengine

This package is auto-generated by [`stubgen`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html) command. And it also
contains **some manual code updates. So who updates `mongoengine` must re-generate this package!**

1. Run command below. (You must have installed mongoengine in your environment)

```sh
cd mally
stubgen -p mongoengine -o typings
```

2. Open `./typings/mongoengine/document.pyi` and Add two lines to class `Document` below.
   See [example comment](https://github.com/allganize/mally/pull/8324/files#r861485386).

```python
id: ObjectId
objects: QuerySetManager
```
